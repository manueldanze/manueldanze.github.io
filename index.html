					<p>Project Massive is a third-person, massive-multiplayer online, playground, UE5 game prototype.
						Players can interact with the game world and each other.
						A single Server Instance is hosted, to which all players are connected.
						<br>The Prototype was developed with the Unreal Engine 5 Editors Sourcecode Build release
						version 5.2.0 as a Desktop project using Blueprints.
						The Game Server was hosted on a scalable Kubernetes Cluster on Google-Cloud.
						<br>Developed as a Software Project by 3 students over a period of 4 months, in the 4th Semester
						of Computer Science Media at Stuttgart Media University.
						<br><b>Contribution:</b>
						<br>The idea of making a UE5 MMO Game based on a flexible containerized Server Structure,
						Project management, organization and documentation via monday.com, curated the used VCS "Helix
						Core" from Perforce, build and made sure the UE5 Sourcecode Build Editor Version worked for
						every Teammember. I implemented the grabbing/throwing and textchat mechanic, implemented the
						score system and the collision/overlapp handling, the distinction and assigment of points to a
						certain player on the server. I implemented the networking of all systems and build/packaged the
						gameserver. I designed the basketball quest, the glowing orb quest and the scoreboards.
						<br><b>Difficulties: </b>
						<br>To build/package a Gameserver and make use of the networking abilitys of the engine, it was
						neccessary to build the UE5 editor from the free available sourcecode. This process was
						complicated, time consuming and occupied a enormous amount of diskspace. The team had no
						experience with big game engines at all so we figured out how to use the UE5 Editor and
						Blueprints via learning-by-doing. Furthermore we never used a centralized VCS and only had
						little experience with Git. So using Perforce and UE5 challenged our team quite a bit. In lack
						of time and ressources we had to simplify systems and ideas. One Teammember was exlusively
						working on the complicated containerization process and so the workload distribution was very
						difficult. The whole Project was very ambitious for 3 students in only one semester of time, it
						took alot of effort to find the right scale.
						<br><b>Improvements:</b>
						<br>In lack of time and knowhow we had to use several workarounds like the scoresystem in which
						we hardcoded the first three players on the scoreboard. This should be avoided and replaced by a
						rotation through all players on the server. We also could have scaled back parts of the project,
						for example the containerization to free up more resources. With more time and/or Teammembers we
						could have achieved the projects goal more effective.
						<br><b>Learnings:</b>
						<br>I gained experience with UE5 Blueprints programming and the network functionalities of the
						Editor. I experienced many difficulties with the Editor, Perforce as VCS and the whole Engine
						building process, i learned alot while fixing these problems. It is very important that at the
						start of a Project the scale of the Project itself matches the amount of ressources the Team can
						afford. Sometimes it is neccessary to cut parts and scale back the project to be able to fulfill
						milestones and deliver the origin vision of the Project.

					<p>A Bullethell-Arena Local-Multiplayer, Pixelart Game with a Game Master mechanic, made using Java,
						LibGDX and Box2D.
						<br>Developed as a Software Project by 6 students in 3rd Semester of Computer Science Media at
						Stuttgart Media University.
						<br><b>My Contribution:</b>
						<br>Idea and loop, logic of the menu screens, connection of different game systems with the
						Kryonet networking part, logic of ingame screen overlays, object collision and overlapp handling
						via Box2D physics library, loading sprites from a spritesheet, simple CI/CD Pipeline in Gitlabs.
						Furthermore i suggested using SCRUM as part of a agile software development principle for this
						project. I took responsability for the Scrum Master position, moderated the meetings and curated
						the Gitlab ticket system "Issues", the changelog and readme files.
						<br><b>Difficulties:</b>
						<br>It was a challange to keep all 6 team members focused and concentrate the essenz of all
						ideas into the origin vision of the game, without changing the whole concept. We also ran into
						big issues trying to implement the Kryonet Networking library and the Box2D physics library
						halfway during the development and not from the start.
						<br><b>Improvements:</b>
						<br>A good Softwarearchitecture and a idea of the necessary librarys and systems right at the
						beginning is very helpful to avoid time consuming changes during the development.
						<br><b>Learnings:</b>
						<br>I recognized how crucial good planning of the architecture, concept and used librarys is. I
						learned how professional software development containes much more than just writing code. I got
						used to work with a ticket system, how to curate a changlog and set up a CI/CD pipeline.

					<p>A Rogue-Like Dungeon Crawler, made using only Java and JavaFX.
						<br>Developed as a Software Project by 4 students in 2nd Semester of Computer Science Media at
						at Stuttgart Media University.
						<br><b>My Contribution:</b>
						<br>Healthsystem, Itemsystem, Fightsystem, Enemysystem and Sound. Also i was in response to
						fullfill the milestones and distributed work to my fellow students with the help of a trello
						board.
						<br><b>Difficulties:</b>
						<br>The whole Team was very unexperienced in Software Development in general and had never made
						a Game. Nevertheless we achieved our goal via many hours of trial and error.
						<br><b>Improvements:</b>
						<br>With the use a Game Engine and better knowledge of librarys the development process could
						have been way more effective.
						<br><b>Learnings:</b>
						<br>I learned a lot about how game code works and what game engines can take away from the
						developer. I improved my understanding of OOP, the language Java and Gitlabs as Version Control
						System.
