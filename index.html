						A unique triple-I action roguelike - currently under development.
						<br>
						<br>
						In Reignbreaker, players wreak havoc on a dystopian kingdom as Clef, a child soldier turned anarchist rebel. From deep within the gothic sprawl of the Queenâ€™s domain, Clef smashes through legions of hostile high-tech medieval machines to breach the inner sanctums of the Bastion, a giant fortress where the unimaginable riches of the elite are stored. Players must plunder the coffers of the Bastion, smash the kingdom and become The Reignbreaker.
						<br>
						<br>
						<i>I was a programming intern at Studio Fizbin from March to August 2024. During those six months, I worked as a Unity programmer on Reignbreaker.</i>

						A puzzle platformer prototype, inspired by the game 'Thomas Was Alone' by Bithell Games. Created with Unity 2022.3.11f1.
						<br>
						<br>
						<i>Developed as a solo project during my 5th semester of Computer Science Media at Stuttgart Media University in the Winter Semester of 2023/24.</i>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Difficulties</b>
						<ul>
							<li>This was my first time developing a game using the Unity Engine, so I had to learn about specific Unity classes and functionalities like MonoBehaviour and Scriptable Objects.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Improvements</b>
						<ul>
							<li>I was able to utilize my experience from other projects to find a fitting scale and dimension for the prototype right from the beginning.</li>
							<li>The entire development went quite smoothly after I became confident with the idea of making a 'clone' of an existing game. Having a reference point helped me work effectively as a solo developer.
							</li>	
						</ul>
						<b>Learnings</b>
						<ul>
							<li>I learned a lot about Unity-specific functionalities.</li>
							<li>I learned that, with proper planning, it is possible to deliver a good product within the schedule without crunching or being stressed out</li>
							<li>Although this solo development experience was smooth, there were often times when I wished for feedback or the ability to share ideas with team members.</li>

						A third-person, online-multiplayer playground prototype. Created with the Unreal Engine 5.2 (Sourcecode Build) using UE5 Blueprints.
						The game server was hosted on a Kubernetes Cluster on Google-Cloud.
						<br>
						<br>
						<i>Developed as a software project by 3 students over a period of 4 months, in the 4th semester
							of Computer Science Media at Stuttgart Media University.</i>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>My Contribution</b>
						<ul>
							<li>The idea of making a UE5 MMO Game based on a flexible containerized server structure
							</li>
							<li>Project management e.g organization and documentation via monday.com</li>
							<li>Curation of the used version control system Perforce Helix Core</li>
							<li>Built and made sure the UE5 Sourcecode Build Editor Version worked for every team member</li>
							<li>Grabbing/throwing mechanic </li>
							<li>Textchat mechanic</li>
							<li>Score system and the collision/overlap handling</li>
							<li>Distinction and assigment of points to a certain player on the server</li>
							<li>Networking of all systems and build/packaged the gameserver</li>
							<li>Basketball quest, the glowing orb quest and the scoreboards</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Difficulties</b>
						<ul>
							<li>To build/package a game server and make use of the networking abilities of the engine, it
								was
								neccessary to build the UE5 editor from the free available sourcecode. This process was
								complicated, time consuming and occupied an enormous amount of disk space</li>
							<li>The team had no experience with big game engines at all, so we figured out how to use the
								UE5
								Editor and Blueprints via learning-by-doing</li>
							<li>We never used a centralized version control system and only had little experience with Git. So using
								Perforce
								and UE5 challenged our team quite a bit</li>
							<li>Due to lack of time and ressources we had to simplify systems and ideas. One team member was
								exclusively working on the complicated containerization process which made the workload
								distribution difficult</li>
							<li>The whole project was very ambitious for 3 students and only one semester of time. It took
								a lot of effort to find the right scale</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Improvements</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Due to lack of time and know-how we had to use several workarounds like the score system in
								which
								we hardcoded the first three players on the scoreboard. This should be avoided and
								replaced
								by a rotation through all players on the server</li>
							<li>We also could have scaled back parts of the project, for example the containerization to
								free up more resources. With more time and/or team members we could have achieved the
								project's goal more effectively</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Learnings</b>
						<ul>
							<li>I gained experience with UE5 Blueprints programming and the network functionalities of
								the
								editor</li>
							<li>I had many difficulties with the editor, Perforce as version control system and the whole Engine
								building process, I learned a lot while fixing these problems</li>
							<li>It is very important, that at the start of a project the scale of the project itself
								matches
								the amount of ressources the team can afford. Sometimes it is necessary to cut parts
								and
								scale the project down in order to be able to fulfill milestones and deliver the original vision.</li>

						A topdown bullethell-arena local-multiplayer with a Game Master mechanic. Created using
						Java, LibGDX and Box2D.
						<br>
						<br>
						<i>Developed as a software project by 6 students in 3rd semester of Computer Science Media at
							Stuttgart Media University.</i>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>My Contribution</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Game idea of a bullet-hell arena multiplayer</li>
							<li>Logic of the menu screens</li>
							<li>Connection of different game systems with the Kryonet networking part</li>
							<li>Logic of ingame screen overlays</li>
							<li>Object collision and overlap handling via Box2D physics library</li>
							<li>Loading sprites from a spritesheet</li>
							<li>Simple CI/CD pipeline in Gitlabs</li>
							<li>I suggested using SCRUM as part of an agile software development principle for this
								project. I took responsibility for the Scrum Master position, moderated the meetings and
								curated the Gitlab ticket system "Issues", the changelog and readme files</li>
						</ul>

						<b>Difficulties</b>
						<ul>
							<li>It was a challenge to keep all 6 team members focused and concentrate the essence of all
								ideas into the original vision of the game without changing the whole concept</li>
							<li>We had issues with different ideas for the game design of the core gameplay, which in the end did not work out as planned and ended up in a non functional gameplay loop</li>		
							<li>We also ran into big issues trying to implement the Kryonet Networking library and the
								Box2D physics library, halfway during the development and not from the start</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Improvements</b>
						<ul>
							<li>A good software architecture and an idea of the necessary libraries and systems right at
								the beginning, could have been very helpful to avoid the time consuming changes during the development
							</li>
							<li>Better communication and idea of the basic gameplay would have lead to a more satisfying development process and final result</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Learnings</b>
						<ul>
							<li>I learned how to use libraries and frameworks and made my first experiences with LibGDX and Box2D</li>
							<li>I experienced the importance of interesting and consistent game design in order to keep the gameplay loop working</li>
							<li>I recognized how crucial good planning of the architecture, concept and used libraries is</li>
							<li>I got used to work with a ticket system, how to curate a changlog and set up a CI/CD
								pipeline</li>

						A rogue-like dungeon crawler, created using Java and JavaFX.
						<br>
						<br>
						<i>Developed as a software project by 4 students in 2nd Semester of Computer Science Media at
							at Stuttgart Media University.</i>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>My Contribution</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Healthsystem, itemsystem, fightsystem, enemysystem and sound</li>
							<li>i was in response to fullfill the milestones and distribute work to my fellow students
								with the help of a Trello board</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Difficulties</b>
						<ul>
							<li>The whole team was very unexperienced in software development in general and had never
								made a game before. We achieved our goal via many hours of trial and error</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Improvements</b>
						<ul>
							<li>By using a game engine and having better knowledge of libraries the development process
								could have been way more effective.</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Learnings</b>
						<ul>
							<li>I learned a lot about how game code works and how much work game engines can take off the developer's hands</li>
							<li>I improved my understanding of object oriented programming, the language Java and Gitlabs as version control
								system</li>
